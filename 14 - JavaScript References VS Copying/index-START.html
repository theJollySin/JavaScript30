    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // var players2 = players;
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // players2[0] = "Bob";
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    var players3 = players.slice();
    players3[0] = "Horton";
    console.log(players);
    console.log(players3);

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    var players4 = [].concat(players);
    players4[0] = "Who";
    console.log(players);
    console.log(players4);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    //var players5 = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    var person = {nomen: "Terry Pratchett",
                  job: "Thinker",
                  home: "England"};
    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:
    //var dude = person;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    var terry = Object.assign({}, person);
    terry['job'] = "Author";
    console.table(terry);
    console.table(person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
